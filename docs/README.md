# OctoAcme Project Management Docs Index

## Project Management Process Overview
OctoAcme follows a customer-first, iterative, and data-informed approach to project management. We emphasize clear ownership, small incremental delivery, continuous validation of outcomes, and a blameless culture for learning. Our core principles: customer-first, iterative delivery, clear ownership, data-informed decisions, and psychological safety.

## High-level Lifecycle
1. Initiation — define the problem, stakeholders, success metrics, and one-pager.
2. Planning — break work into prioritized backlog items, estimate, identify dependencies, and create a release plan.
3. Execution — implement, test, review, and track progress toward milestones.
4. Release — deploy with verification, communicate changes, and ensure rollback/mitigation plans.
5. Retrospective & Continuous Improvement — capture learnings, create action items, and measure their impact.

## How to use these docs
- Keep the project one-pager and key artifacts updated in the project repo (docs/ or .copilot/). Copilot Spaces can use these artifacts as context for generating and surfacing project knowledge.
- Use the README as the single source of truth for process navigation and link back into project-specific READMEs for status and roadmap.

## Acceptance Criteria
