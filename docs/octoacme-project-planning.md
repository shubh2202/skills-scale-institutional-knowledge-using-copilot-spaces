# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
6. Create release plan and milestone map

### UX Designer Involvement
**UX Designers** should be engaged early in planning to ensure user-centered design:
- Conduct user research to validate problem statements and assumptions
- Define acceptance criteria for UX requirements (e.g., usability, accessibility, interaction patterns)
- Provide design handoff artifacts: wireframes, mockups, prototypes, design specs
- Participate in sprint planning to align design and development timelines

### Technical Writer Involvement
**Technical Writers** should be consulted during planning to scope documentation needs:
- Identify user-facing features that require documentation updates
- Estimate documentation effort (user guides, release notes, FAQs)
- Align on documentation deliverables and timelines
- Schedule documentation reviews with subject matter experts

## Backlog Item Template

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
- Timebox planning to agreed sprint length
- Pull items that meet DoD and have clear acceptance criteria
- Ensure team capacity is respected

## Risk & Dependency Management
- Capture in Risk Register:
  - ID, Description, Impact, Probability, Owner, Mitigation
- Mark cross-team dependencies in the project board and escalate during weekly syncs
